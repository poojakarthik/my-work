I think I should include $arrParams['Type']   (either "Output" or "Input") again
so that checkboxes and radiobuttons can be rendered as disabled checkboxes and radiobuttons.
HtmlTemplates->RadioButtons() could render the control as disabled, if rendering it as an output property
A property that could be displayed as radio buttons could have 2 contexts defined in UIAppDocumentation.
One which renders it as disabled radio buttons, and one which renders it as a label.
(DONE 20th June)

Amount applied = Payment.Amount - Payment.Balance
unless if the Payment has been reversed (check the status) in which case
Amount applied = 0

TODO
look at Payments class to see what payments are retrieved (based on their status)
It should probably only be PAYMENT_WAITING, PAYMENT_PAYING, PAYMENT_FINISHED and PAYMENT_REVERSED
Check out the classes located in intranet_app/classes/payments/
None of the stuff in this directory looks relevant

TODO
Work on the context menu

The drop down list of invoices for a given payment (in the drop down details of the payment table)
Should be ordered by invoice number.  It is currently ordered by descending id of the InvoicePayments table
you will have to sort the list of invoices.
(FIXED it now orders them by invoice Id)(DONE 20th June)

In the Invoice Table:
	Invoice.Tax is always 10% of Invoice.Total

In the current Invoice table of the View Invoices and Payments screen of vixen:
	Total of this bill = Invoice.Tax + Invoice.Total

TODO
I am concerned about how the spacing of properties is done when they are displayed as "Label : Value"
We want to make the spacing as small as possible, while still displaying the entire label, and having all the 
values left justified

TODO
Also we should be able to specify the absolute width of a VixenTable
We should be able to define a VixenTable to have an absolute width, or a width relative to the tables contents,
or a width that fills the available space in the column of the page
Perhaps the width of each column in a page, should be specified in the page template.

TODO
Implement column widths and alignments in VixenTable (might require java script modification)
Look up how table widths and column alignments work in HTML
