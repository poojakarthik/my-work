I also have to add UIAppDocumentation for employee Id, FirstName, LastName
because I don't want to display these with accompanying labels, use the context NO_LABEL
which the label() method will check and supress labels.


Problem to solve:
How would I flag the data attributes DBO()->KnowledgeBase->CreatedBy and 
DBO()->KnowledgeBase->AuthorisedBy so that they are not printed out if RenderOutput() is
called on them?
Answer: If these properties aren't defined in the UiAppDocumentation table of the database
then they can't be displayed with RenderOutput() or RenderInput();


BreadCrumbsFramework::ShowInfo needs to be changed
I also need to add docblocks to the BreadCrumbsFramework class and the MenuItems class
DONE


Things what I've done, Gov'
implemented BreadCrumbsFramework::ShowInfo() and ::Info()
stuck docblocks in the MenuItems and BReadCrumbsFramework classes
fixed the DBObject::Info() method so that it now also outputs property definition data
fixed the DBObject::ShowInfo method so that it now also outputs property definition data
fixed the DBList::ShowInfo method so that it now also outputs property definition data
Updated the docblocks in:
	html_template/breadcrumb.php




The knowledge base document viewer does not currently authenticate the user.  I guess this should be added.
