With regard to the bread crumbs menu, you might want to display variables in the link,
differently to how they will have to be used in the HREF link.

For example a service is a 10 digit number, but you might want to space it
in the label.

label = Service: 07 3250 4200
HREF = view_service.php?Service.Id=0732504200

I would need to store an input mask for each variable in a breadcrumb
Jared said we don't have to bother with this, at this stage.
