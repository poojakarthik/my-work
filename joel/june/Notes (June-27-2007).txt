all validation should happen through the DBO()-tableName
not in javascript.

you should just send all the data, as it currently is via (AJAXLoad), and then in the Application Template,
it will run Validate on the object and if it is invalid, then it will output an appropriate message.



I fixed up functions.php::GetEmployeeName so now it caches the employees
(DONE)


vixen.php/$AppTemplate/$method/?Account.Id=1234


check out http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.5 which talks about <button> elements

pages in the new framework can now be accessed through:
localhost/joel/vixen/ui_app/vixen.php/Account/InvoicesAndPayments/?Account.Id=1234

TODO tomorrow
Write down all the stuff that is on the board
Implement it
(OK)
