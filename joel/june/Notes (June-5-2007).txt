When DBObject::Load() is called, it doesn't validate the data once it has been loaded.
It sets the DBObject->_bolValid to NULL;

Should it validate the data?


I am also a little concerned about how you retrieve data by seting the idColumn variable.
I think this might become an issue.  Especially when DBO() is used to insert a new record
into a table.  Infact, I don't think we even tested the save() function of DBObject.



I think the various layers of data validation have to be better defined and implemented.
Would validating data that has just been loaded from the database be a different process
to validating data that has been input by the user?


Id		int
Title		varchar
Abstract	longtext
Content		longtext
CreatedBy	int
CreatedOn	datetime
LastUpdated	datetime
AuthorisedBy	int
AuthorisedOn	datetime

I also have to add UIAppDocumentation for employee Id, FirstName, LastName
because I don't want to display these with accompanying labels, use the context NO_LABEL
which the label() method will check and supress labels.

Within an extended HtmlTemplate class, can I echo values, or should I always use
->RenderOutput()?
