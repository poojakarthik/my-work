Should the check box and the radio buttons in the Account Details object be disabled?
No they shouldn't.  The user will want to be able to modify them and save the changes.

Within the MenuItems class, each method that relates to a menu item that can be displayed in a popup window
will have to store a reference to the html template used in that popup window.  Then, when the ContextMenu()->BuildArray()
is called, it will have to include the reference to each html template required, so that Page->RenderContextMenu can
instantiate each of the html templates and run their Render method.
(22-6-2007: Disregard the above paragraph)

But will there ever be a popup window that requires more than one html template? In which case, a page template would need to be specified.
(Yes.  ShowAjaxPopup will execute an Application Template which will render a page)

Taking the Add Adjustment popup as an example; when you add the adjustment the popup window will close and the Invoice and Payments
screen will reload.  Is this how it's going to work?  What if you have rows highlighted within the page?  The highlighting will disappear.
(I think we will update the page using AJAX)

Jared should checkout DBList::Load, where the passed in WHERE clause parameters are being used.
I think it tests for the same thing twice.
It doesn't hurt it or anything.  I just don't think it looks right.  I've stuck in a FIXME! where it is.


Things I have done today:
created html_templates/note/view.php
made some date and time output masks


What happens when a payment is made against all accounts in an account group?


TODO
the account details html template within the invoices and payments screen will need an "Apply Changes" button 
so that the user can commit the changes made to the checkbox and radio buttons
(DONE, although it doesn't work)



Make this function.  It will have to store the list of hidden objects in a global array
Global: AddHiddenObject
(We are not going to implement this any more)

Create the MenuItem method "ViewNotes"

A module should be made to load the required notes into DBL()->Note and DBL()->NoteType.
You might want to load all notes for a given account, or service, or just load notes for an account thar have NoteType=System Notice

Things to do via AJAX: (on the invoices and payments screen)
Notes
Add adjustment
Add recurring Adjustment
Add Payment


TODO (tomorrow)
Make a new layout template for popups which will just be one column and no title or BreadcrumbMenu or ContextMenu
Make a page template for View Notes	
Make a Menu Item method for View Notes which returns the string "javascript:ShowAjaxPopup(strSize, 'Notes.View', $strParams)"
where $strParams is in JSON notation such as:
{
	'Objects':
		{
			'Account':
				{
					'Id': 1000163204
				}
		}
}
or rather: "{'Objects':{'Account':{'Id': 1000163204}}}"
Make an application template for Notes, with a method called View. 
	This loads DBL()->Note and DBL()->NoteType
	SubmittedData::Ajax() which is called in Application::AjaxLoad (which is called from the javascript ShowAjaxPopup(...))
		should have defined DBO()->Account->Id = 1000163204 (but not loaded it)
