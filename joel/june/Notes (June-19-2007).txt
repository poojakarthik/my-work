The line:
DBO()->Account->BusinessName->RenderLink(Href()->ViewAccount(DBO()->Account->Id->Value));

fucks up because it does not remember that the property being worked on within "RenderLink" is BusinessName.
It thinks it is Account->Id.
Jared says the above line should always look like:
	$intAccountId = DBO()->Account->Id->Value;
	$strHref = Href()->ViewAccount($intAccountId);
	DBO()->Account->BusinessName->RenderLink($strHref);
for readability purposes, so this won't be a problem.

Do account options  (stick this in the Account Details Html Template)

I should make a function called GetEmployeeName($intEmployeeId, Context) so that we can display employee names instead of their ids
(DONE)

TODO
stuff to go in the payments detail
amount paid against individual invoices (for the payment)
Invoice#	amount(for the individual invoice)
(DONE 20th June)

TODO
Link the Adjustments table to the invoice table on InvoiceRun  (an adjustment(charge) can only be applied to a single invoice, 
but an invoice can have many adjustments applied to it)
(also link the invoice table to the adjustments table (on InvoiceRun))
Link the Recurring Adjustments table to the invoice table on InvoiceRun.  I think the idea is that selecting a recurring adjustment
should deselect all invoices, payments and adjustments.
The linking of multiple tables is not working
If I include row detail for the invoices table, then both the payment and adjustment tables get selected properly,
but if I don't include row data, then it doesn't work.
If I select a charge, it should highlight the invoice that the charge was applied to, which should inturn highlight the payments
that the invoice is associated with.  Currently the associated payments do not get selected.

TODO
fix all those small images you made so that they are 24x24
(DONE 19th June)

TODO
Stick in the "pdf link" and "detail link" for the invoice table.  They should include little icons.
(DONE 19th June)

Values of properties rendered with RenderOutput do not currently fit in the tool tips window.  This is because
the CSS class DefaultOutput has padding-left = 200px
This could be solved by defining a new context for tool tips within UIAppDocumentation, which uses a different CSS class
each property that will be displayed in a tool tip window will need to have UIAppDocumention data specifying this context.

TODO
How would we go about disabling a check box?  originally there was $arrParam['Type'] which was either "Input" or "Output".
If this was passed to the checkbox function, and equal to "Output" then the check box could be rendered as disabled
I should implement this because right now, if a checkbox is rendered as a label, it will display something along the
lines of "disable DDR : 1"
