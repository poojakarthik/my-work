Finish the "Add Adjustment" popup and don't forget to add doc blocks to your javascript


TODO
Add a "view source" button to the header of the popup windows which will only display if you are in debug mode.
If you click on the button, it should open a page with the source code of the popup window.
When defining an anchor, if you set target='_blank', it will open the href in a new window.  Target defaults to "_self"
which opens the href in the current window.  You will use this to open the source code in a separate window.



When you are converting a php data structure to JSON notation, I think you have to make sure that you
escape all the apostrophes properly.
Actualy, when you pass Json code to a javascript function in the form:
<script type='text/javascript'>Vixen.menu.Render($strJsonCode);</script>
You do not have to encapsulate $strJsonCode in apostrophes.
I'm pretty sure Json()->encode handles apostrophes just fine.


TODO
We need a function that will return the employee Id of the currently logged in employee.
TODO
make a function called AuthenticatedEmployee() which returns a DBObject containing the record from the Employee table
relating to the currently logged in user.
I called it GetAuthenticatedUserDBObject() as there was already a method called AuthenticatedUser() which returned
the singleton Application object.
Currently GetAuthenticatedUserDBObject() includes a HACK.  It will only ever return details for Employee.Id = 29, which is me.

I am currently working on VixenValidateAdjustmentClass.IsValidForm validating the data
