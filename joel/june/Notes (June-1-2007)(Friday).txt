The breadcrumb menu

there will be a little menu along the top of the page like:

Acc:10001234/service:0732504200/provisioning
This will be how it is displayed on the provisioning page


on the provisioning page of service:07 32504200
of account:10001234




Check out how the MenuToken works along with ContextMenuFramework.
Pay particular attention to the data attributes of MenuToken as well
as its __get function.


I found a possible bug in the ContextMenuFramework class. 
Apparently you can't have a menu item in the lowest menu level
ContextMenu()->Do_Something_Bitch(122121212);
