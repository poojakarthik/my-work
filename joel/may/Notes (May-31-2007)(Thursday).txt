The constructor of the submitted_data class (found in application_loader.php)
is called __Construct when it should be called __construct

Also the class submitted_data should probably be called SubmittedData



DBOFramework::$_arrProperty stores an array of DBObjects.  Shouldn't this 
be called $_arrObjects so as not to confuse "Objects" and "Properties"?


The DBList looks like it's working but because it stores an array of DBObjects
and because they store $_arrDefine (the documentation) isn't this a big waste of memory?
Especially considering you can retrieve the same data using Config->Get(...) which caches
it.
perhaps DBObject::$_arrDefine could be a pointer to the definition structure within the
Config class?
See the line "$this->_arrDefine = Config()->Get('Dbo', $strName);" in DBObject::__construct
