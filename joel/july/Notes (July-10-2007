BUG!
There is a bug with the add recurring adjustment popup.  If a value is typed in incorrectly and the page has
to reload, the function Vixen.ValidateRecurringAdjustment.InitialiseForm() is not getting called.  It should be, but it isn't.
(FIXED)

There is currently a hack in HtmlTemplateAccountPaymentList->Render() which sets
	$bolHasAdminPerm = TRUE;
because I don't believe the line:
	$bolHasAdminPerm = AuthenticatedUser()->UserHasPerm(PRIVILEGE_ADMIN);
is working for whatever reason.  I think it's because we aren't having the user log in to the system yet.
I remember AuthenticatedUser()->_arrUser['Id'] was returning 0


Now make the DeletePayment Popup
Have it generic passing in the text to display




Have an AppTemplate method and a HtmlTemplate that displays a generic Delete Record popup.
	This popup will have a button that you will set to load a specific delete method within an application template
