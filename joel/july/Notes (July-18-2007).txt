Problems with the version on catwalk:

I noticed there are a few money value fields in the existing system that are colored depending on whether 
their value is positive, negative or zero.  We have only done this for the account balance.
This includes the invoices table.

Should the buttons in the invoices Vixen Table always show up?

When you add a recurring adjustment in the old system, it sets CreatedOn, StartedOn and LastChargedOn to today's date.
I have updated the new system to do this too.

When a recurring charge is added in the existing system, it sets LastChargedOn to the current date, but sets TotalRecursions to 0.  
Should it be doing this?

When a debit charge is added in the existing system, it sets ChargedOn to the current date and it sets Status to CHARGE_WAITING (100)
In the new system we set Status to 101 for debit adjustments and Status = 100 for credit adjustments

I have updated the app template methods that add charges and recurring charges so that they set all the date fields the same as 
the existing system does, but I have not changed the Charge.status issue for debit charges.

Adding a payment looks like it's doing the same thing in both systems

(all these issues have been resolved; regarding descripancies between how the old system and new system operate)
