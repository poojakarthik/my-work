Work on the "View Unbilled Charges for Service" page
(DOING)

When submitting a form, I have a feeling we will have to make sure all the data still exists between the form loading
and submitting it. Effectively putting a lock on the records used.  I'm not making any sense.
What I'm trying to get at, is that the user shouldn't be able to update records that they're not allowed to, or access records they
are not allowed through, either by editting the GET variables for a url, or making their own javascript code, that triggers ajax calls


TODO
Check out that astrix note you wrote at the buttom of the web_app spec.  Ask Rich about it.


Framework->GetUnbilledCharges() only uses charges with status=CHARGE_APPROVED but credit charges are listed as CHARGE_WAITING.
In the web_app I should only show charges that have been approved.


You can't currently modify properties of a DBObject when used in a foreach loop as it gives you a copy of the DBObject, not a reference.
You would have to modify the functions of the DBListBase class which implement the iterator interface.

The current client app lets the user view all CDRs that have status == STATUS_RATED or STATUS_TEMP_INVOICE
but the new functions Rich wrote only deal with CDRs that have status == STATUS_RATED
Find out what sort of CDRs I should be displaying in the paginated list of calls.
(check out client_app/classes/unbilled/unbilledcalls.php::__construct)
(Check out the note in AppTemplateService::ViewUnbilledCharges() where I am retrieving the CDRs to display)

TODO!
Also in the "View Unbilled Charges for Account" page of the client app, I calculate the total unbilled CDRs for each service
that the user has.  This is done as a separate query for each service.  Will this take a really long time, because the table
is so fucking big?  For example, if the Account has 10 services attached to it, each one will have an "unbilled total CDRs"
calculated for it, which will traverse the CDR table to calculate the unbilled total

YOU ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON web_app/html_template/service/cdr_list.php
How are you going to incorporate pagination so that it is general enough to use elsewhere?
Maybe you should store a hidden property in the html template which is the page number
