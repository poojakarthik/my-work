You are working on the ability to do an AjaxSubmit and render which just updates a div on the page.

The object that gets sent via ajax has a property called strContainerDivId which should be the id of the div container
for the HtmlTemplate

You will add the rendered data of the html Template to the div in the same fashion that is used to update the contents of a popup.


TODO
How does the popup correctly load the javascript?

In the current way I'm updating divs through ajax calls, I don't think it loads any new javascript, or destroys any old js objects in
memory, unless a script is run within the render method of the HtmlObject

I don't want to have to specify the id of the HtmlTemplate when I explicitly create it in an AppTemplate Method.
TODO
I also want to send back a rendered HtmlTemplate, and some commands, so that I can stick all the error messages in popup boxes.



Rich made some functions that you will be using.
framework/functions.php::UnbilledServiceCDRTotal
and			UnbilledServiceChargesTotal
framework/functions.php::UnbilledAccountCDRTotal
Do these include GST? the UnbilledCharges function does.
He's also making a GetCurrentRatePlanForService() function which returns the Id of the current rate plan for a specified service



If I want to render a HtmlTemplate:
	I need to define the Html that will be rendered
	I need to declare which parent element to put it in, or which element to overwrite

What if I just want to return
