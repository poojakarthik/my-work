BUG!
There is currently a problem with the "Add Recurring Adjustment" popup.  We are getting an "uncaught exception: null" error/warning
and the initalising of the "Times to Charge" is not occuring.  The error is occuring in axaj.js line 241
PARTIAL FIX! This being is being caused by the addEventListener() line of ValidateRecurringAdjustment.InitialiseForm in
validate_recurring_adjustment.js.  I have commented this out but, it will eventually need to be included.


You have not finished the javascript required for Add Recurring Adjustment.



In the tooltip detail of the vixen tables, dates of 00/00/0000 are not being formatted properly.

TODO
Remove that function (DeleteRecordPopup) you added yesterday to the popup class 

TODO
at some point you will have to go through each of the WHERE clauses for invoices and payments and make sure the conditions are correct.

TODO
GetEmployeeName doesn't return anything if the employee's id is 0 (which usually denotes the system was responsible for the action).
It should probably return "System" or "Mr System" or "Pablo" in this case.

TODO
I think I should change the way I'm saving TimeStamps to the database.

TODO
Currently there is a HACK in each of the appTemplate methods that handle the deleting of records.
The user's permsission is not properly checked to see if they are allowed to delete records.
This hack is also in the HtmlTemplates that display the tables of the InvoicesAndPayments page.
The checking of the user's permissions inside the AppTemplate delete methods, should be in the SubmittedForm block of code

TO ASK JARED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Do we show archived Recurring Adjustments? in the list of Recurring Adjustments?  (I currently am)
(ANSWER: we do not show archived ones)
Also, what is required in order to delete a recurring adjustment?
(ANSWER: you already know this)
Should I do this as a transaction? so that if any of the modifications to the database fail, the whole transaction is rolled back? I would think so.
(YES YOU SHOULD)

TODO TODO TODO
Implement transactions with the delete Payment and delete adjustment appTemplate methods (incase a note fails to save)
(DONT WORRY ABOUT THIS)

TODO TOMORROW!!!  LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME!
Fix the UserHasPerm thing

Fix the delete popup for when you are deleting a Recurring adjustment and you want to see how much the charge will be.
(DONE 12th July)

Also add a cancel button to this popup.
