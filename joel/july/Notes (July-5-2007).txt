Things that still need to be done on the Invoices and Payments screen:

Add Note Popup
Add Recurring Adjustment popup
Add the "Add" buttons to the bottom of each of the tables along the right hand side of the page
Add functionality to refresh the page, once a record has been successfully added (This will be done through Json commands sent via ajax)
Fix up the context menu. (Things can be seen through it, at the moment) I think this can be fixed by setting it's z index to 1 (but then you would have to reset the popup div z indexes to 2 and 3
Fix up the "View pdf" and "View invoice details" links on the invoice table
add "delete" buttons for each row of each table (these will be displayed only if the user has delete priviledges) (steal the image from phpMyAdmin)
Make sure the user authentication is working properly
Remove bread crumb menu (i think)
Fix up all the style sheets and formatting of the page and all the popups
Submenus of the context menu should probably disappear as soon as a menu item is selected
View Notes popup requires a scrollbar down the left hand side
Fix up the debug button for the popups
Should payments that are applied to a payment group, be shown in the Payments table on the InvoicesAndPayments page?  They currently are not.
How do we denote manditory fields in a form?
Tabbing through fields on a popup will eventually start tabbing through fields on the parent page.
If you scroll the Invoices And Payments page down and then open a popup, the div that is supposed to cover the whole screen and make it dark, does not cover the bottom bit.
The ChargeType combo box in the Add Adjustment popup should not have a blank option.  It should default to the first ChargeType in the list.
Currently we specify a container div in the render method of HtmlTemplates that are being included in popups (ie PopupLarge, PopupMedium).  I think this should be moved to VixenPopupClass.Create javascript
What kinds of Payments should be listed in the payments table? (ie payments with what status? should reveresed payments be displayed?)
Stick in pagination of the tables (I could have these do HTML_MODE Ajax calls which will just update the div, so that the page doesn't have to reload.  This would look awesome)
Which popups should be modal and which ones shouldn't? currently they are all modal and I don't think we have accomodated for having multiple popups
	of the same time open.  The id of each popup is currently hardcoded into the MenuItem.
Pablo's helpful descriptions of the properties, is not implemented in the new framework
GetAuthenticatedUserDBObject() only ever returns employee details relating to me (employee.id = 29)
javascript autoloader is not always physically loading the javascript before it is used.  See the AddAdjustment HtmlTemplate for an example of this.
Change the View notes popup so you can choose to just view system notes, or view all notes that aren't system notes, etc (see todo below)

TODO 
With the View Notes popup, you have to give them the option of viewing system notes only, or non-system notes only, or notes relating to the account
or notes relating to a service.  You can implement this with several different MenuItems, or just modify the ViewNotes popup.

BUG!
Now that we are catching and discarding all enter keys pressed, you cannot press enter on any of the controls on a popup/page.


With the current way that MenuItems are done, you cannot have 2 menu items with the same name that do different things.  What if you wanted a submenu
called Notes, and a submenu called Account and they both had a menu item in them called "Add"?

TODO
Things to do today (more specifically than what is in the list above)
I should probably change DBO()->AccountToApplyTo->Id to DBO()->Payment->AccountToApplyTo, but I think
it might try and save this value when you do DBO()->Payment->Save(). Find out if it does.
I can do this so long as a explicitly set the columns to use during the save, using DBO()->Payment->SetColumns()
(Don't bother doing this.  It's working fine how it is, and the code is just as easy to read)

Check out that note you put in your phone.

TODO
In the ChargeType combo box of the Add adjustment page, it should just default to the first Charge Type.  The user shouldn't
be able to choose the blank option.  Although eventually you will have to error trap against there being no Charge Types in the database,
but logically this case should never occur.

TODO
View Notes is not currently working.  I'm pretty sure it's because we changed the way the MenuItems work.  Check out the menu item for it.
(DONE)

TODO
When a property is rendered as an input (textbox), and doesn't have a value, the textbox will have a space char in it.  I don't want it to
have anything in it.  I think this is being done with the HtmlElement->BuildParam, has it sticks a &nbsp; char in as the value if there isn't one.
(DONE)

TODO (ASK JARED)
Is the fixed column of the ChargeType table only relevent when the charge has a service specified for it?


THE LAST THING I WAS WORKING ON
you are trying to get the formatted Amounts working in the HtmlTemplateAdjustmentAdd class
DONE, 6th July

Make sure the Charge Amount can't be null
(DONE, 6th July)
