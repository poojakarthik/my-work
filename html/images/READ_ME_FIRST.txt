Instructions for adding images to the system

1)  Add the image (or image collection) allong with any documentation to a new 
	folder within the 'collection' folder
		eg. images/collection/new_collection

2)  Copy any images to be used into a new folder within the 'working' folder.
	The new folder must have the same name as the folder in 'collection'
		eg. images/working/new_collection/new_image.png

3)  Rename the image in the 'working' folder to it's final name
		eg. images/working/new_collection/final_image.png

4)  Copy the renamed image to the 'Original' folder
		eg. images/original/final_image.png

5)  Use Gimp to manipulate the image within the 'working' folder

6)  Save working images as multi-layer xcf files, this will make it easier to go
	back and make changes to the image at a later date. All major changes
	to the image should be made on a new layer.
		eg. images/working/new_collection/final_image.xcf

7)  Copy the finished image to the 'used' folder
		eg. images/used/final_image.png

8)  Copy the final image to its required location within the vixen system
		eg. intranet_app/images/final_image.png

9)  Document the image in 'images.ods'

10) Ensure that everything you have added is also added to svn
