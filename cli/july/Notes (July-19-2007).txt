BUG!

BUG!
I don't think the cookie's expiration time is being updated each time Authoriasation is done.
(FIXED)

There is a bug in the payments table; when a payment is reversed the amount is being displayed as the amount of the payment.
It should be displaying zero.
(FIXED Reversed payments are now marked as reversed in the table)
minx will require the new version of ui_app/html_template/account/payment_list.php


Files that have proper doc blocks through them:
ui_app/app_template/
	TODO!
