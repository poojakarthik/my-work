Finish the javascript for the Add Recurring Adjustments popup.  Make it work exactly like the existing one.

Tell Jared about the reloading the form when it has posted data on it (clicking Apply Changes and then doing anything that reloads the form)

Context Menu and Breadcrumb Menu
Should we have the same menu options as the existing system?

Conduct formal testing.

Login stuff doesn't work if you are currently working on a popup and then you need to log in.
(At least, I'm pretty sure it doesn't work at the moment)

TODO!!!  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have not denoted required fields in any of the forms

TODO!!!
check the TXN
(In the current system the only validation on this field is that it cannot be an empty string or NULL)


remove the debug button from the popups
it's declared at the top of Vixen.js 
(DONE)


If the user tabs off a popup and it's scrolled down the screen then the screen will probably scroll up to the 
top and you loose the popup, unless you back tab, back to it.



I fixed up the messages regarding deleting payments, adjustments and recurring adjustments.
