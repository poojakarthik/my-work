Fix the UserHasPerm thing
(TOMORROW)


BUG! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When the page is reloaded (after a record is added) my system now asks me if I want to resend the POST data
REASON:
Applying Changes changes the url we are using because it uses POST instead of GET.  This will probably become a 
problem as everything will eventually be using POST.  It's a problem when I use the Ajax()->AddCommand("ReloadCurrentPage");

DO the Last Charge date = // thing when you get back.
(DONE)



TODO TOMORROW!!! LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME 
With the Labels in UI_APPDocumentation regarding "(inc GST)", these should not be specified for the default context.
