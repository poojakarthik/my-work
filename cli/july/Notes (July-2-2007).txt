TODO
Now that I have binded a hidden input to all checkboxes, make sure that this works with Vixen.Ajax.SendForm().
I think it should work fine because the checkbox won't have a name, and therefore its name won't be in the format Object.Property.
(DONE) (it works fine)

TODO
check that DBObject->Save() will handle updating only a few columns of a record
DONE (You have to make sure you call DBObject->SetColumns before you do save)

ASK JARED ABOUT THIS!!! (from last Friday)
I have a feeling there will be situations where we will want to attach javascript to an event on a radiobutton or checkbox, but
if we use the RenderInput method to render the checkbox or radio, we can't specify things like "onclick" or "onchange".  Can we 
specify these after the RenderInput so long as we associate it with the id or name of the Property?
