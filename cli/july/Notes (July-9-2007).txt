Things I have to do ASAP (Must be finished by the end of Wednesday)

Delete payment and delete adjustment will open a popup which has Ok and Cancel buttons.
You will also be able to include a note.  This should be a standard popup.  How would I go about that?
Have the "Ok" button do two Ajax calls. One to do the delete and one to insert the note.  Actually
this should be done with 1 call.


Email pdf functionality, will require a popup that lists the email of each contact associated with the account,
as a checkbox, and also a textbox so that other email addresses can be manually added.  


cancel recurring adjustment popup (with notes box)

When including the "Delete" functionality on the Invoices and Payments page, check the user's permissions
when you are rendering the delete buttons, and you will also need to check the user's permissions when
you actually commit the delete. (That would be in the application template)

Make those changes to the View Notes Popup (Nathan has done this)


TO DO TOMORROW
Recurring adjustments are successfully being added to the database, but then the page isn't working properly.
but if it works then the popup should be closed anyway, so just make sure it works when the text boxes are invalid
