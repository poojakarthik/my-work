Things to do today
Fix the AddCommand calls that I have used in the app templates
(DONE)

Fix the user authentication stuff in each of the app templates
(DONE but not completely tested)

TODO!!!!!
Ask Jared about how the javascript is working in "Add Recurring Adjustment".  Is it working the way you want it to?
ANSWER: do it exactly like the existing system.  They must be able to explicitly specify a minimum charge AND a recuring charge that isn't quite
a multiple of the minimum charge.

Tell Jared about the reloading the form when it has posted data on it (clicking Apply Changes and then doing anything that reloads the form)

Context Menu and Breadcrumb Menu
Should we have the same menu options as the existing system?

TODO
Remove the H-Hole tax charge type

Should balance in the Account Details htmlTemplate declare that GST is included in it?

BUG!
I had to log into both systems
(This is not a bug, you were using dps and localhost)

Checked all the GST stuff
It looks like it's working propperly

BUG!
There are magic variables used in AppTemplateNote::View()


What Payment statuses can I delete?
You get a list of:
	PAYMENT_WAITING
	PAYMENT_PAYING
	PAYMENT_FINISHED
	PAYMENT_REVERSED
You can delete:
	PAYMENT_WAITING
	PAYMENT_PAYING
	PAYMENT_FINISHED
Make sure you check for this status type in AppTemplatePayment::Delete()
(DONE)
