I'm starting the Web interface for customers today.

Will I be making it look like the new intranet application, or more like the existing client app?

The actual live client app looks different to the one in client app.



make the new program in the directory: "web_app"
In this directory you will have to make the following unique files:
	vixen.php
	require.php
	definitiions.php
	ajax_link.php
	css.php

You will be using the base application/framework from ui_app, 
but make the following directories to hold the specific templates for the client app:
	web_app/app_template
	web_app/page_template
	web_app/html_template
	web_app/ajax_template

use ui_app/layout_template and ui_app/style_template
NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! 
NOTE: I think I should make layout_template and style_template directories in web_app, because you might want to make these specific
to the client web application.  They shouldn't really be considered part of the framework, except for the html_elements.php file.
perhaps html_elements.php should be in the root directory and style_template should just store default.css

layout_templates have to be copied because they specify things like "RenderVixenHeader" and "RenderBreadCrumbMenu", which are specific
to the application. (The client app will not have a vixen header (to my understanding anyway))
NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! NOTE!!! 

you should probably make web_app/img/ as well, because you will be using images specific to this page, 
and I don't want to mix them up with the images in intranet_app.

I think I will also have to make a new login.php file and stick it in web_app.  Currently the intranet_app login.php is being used,
so you might want to copy that one.

Currently the CheckAuth method is in Application and only authorizes employees.
Should I make a new method used to authorize clients? or should I modify CheckAuth so it can handle both
Employees and Clients?
I will be making a new method called Application->CheckClientAuth()

TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! TODO!!! 
What about things like "html_template/vixen_header.php" ? This is hard coded into the Page->RenderHeader method found in framework.php.
Should we modify the Page->RenderHeader, so you can specify what HtmlTemplate to use as the header?  or maybe add method called
Page->SetHeader($strHeaderHtmlTemplate) which will be called from within the page template.
There is a method called Page->RenderVixenHeader() which renders this HtmlTemplate.  Just make another one called
Page->RenderClientHeader();
(DONE) (I've made a method called Page->RenderClientHeader)


TODO!!!
You should probably copy Default.css over to web_app as it should be specific to the app.
html_elements should probably be put in the ui_app directory because it is part of the framework and is not really specific to the application
(DONE)

TODO!!!
There are things in the framework class like the MenuItems class that is specific to the application (intranet app/ client app).
These should probably be moved into their own files, so that they are unique to the application.
It's not that impoortant right now.  Not until I start adding in Menu Items specific to the Client app.  At which stage I will move the 
MenuItems class into its own file called menu_items.php and this will be included in require.php

TODO!!!
For everything that I add to framework.php and functions.php, make sure you clearly mark it as belonging to the web_app so that if 
you have to remove it, you'll know where it is.  Do the whole "//********************CLIENT WEB APP STUFF*****************" thing.

TODO!!! 
I should probably move all the images that I need into web_app/img/template
