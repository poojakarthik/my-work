At the console page have a combo box, where the user can choose which account to work with.

When they choose an account, the details will be displayed on the screen.
	I could eventually do this as an ajax template so the page doesn't visibly reload.

The page should default to their primary account.  
All buttons on the page will refer to the currently displayed account.
