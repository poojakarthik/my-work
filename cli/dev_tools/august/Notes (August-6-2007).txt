The web app should probably have a minimum length to the page rendered so that things look uniform.  Right now, if an error
message is displayed, the page is only about 150 pixels long

I think the current way that the CheckClientAuth and CheckAuth work, prohibits the user from logging in on more than 1 machine at a time.
Who gives a shit?  You have bigger things to worry about.

There is the distinct possibilty that when account details are loaded into the console page, the balance is incorrect, because we are
now looking at it through the point of view of the client.  This will either be an issue with the coloring of the balance, or the signage of the balance
