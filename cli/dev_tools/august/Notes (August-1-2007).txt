The current client app lets the user view all CDRs that have status == CDR_RATED or CDR_TEMP_INVOICE
but the new functions Rich wrote only deal with CDRs that have status == CDR_RATED
Find out what sort of CDRs I should be displaying in the paginated list of calls.
(check out client_app/classes/unbilled/unbilledcalls.php::__construct)
(Check out the note in AppTemplateService::ViewUnbilledCharges() where I am retrieving the CDRs to display)
Yes, we are supposed to grab all CDR_RATED and CDR_TEMP_INVOICE records

TODO!
Also in the "View Unbilled Charges for Account" page of the client app, I calculate the total unbilled CDRs for each service
that the user has.  This is done as a separate query for each service.  Will this take a really long time, because the table
is so fucking big?  For example, if the Account has 10 services attached to it, each one will have an "unbilled total CDRs"
calculated for it, which will traverse the CDR table to calculate the unbilled total

YOU ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON web_app/html_template/service/cdr_list.php
How are you going to incorporate pagination so that it is general enough to use elsewhere?
Maybe you should store a hidden property in the html template which is the page number


When displaying call information for a given service, we assume that each CDR with Service == <serviceID> has the one FNN



TODO!
The filter combo box
Allow the user to filter the CDRs based on the RecordType of the CDR.  There is a table called RecordType which contains about
38 different types, so I guess the combo box will have all these types in it, plus "Show all Records" as the default option.
This parameter will also have to be passed through the pagination controls.  You could pass Filter.Id = RecordType.Id
When the Combo box changes then reload the page (first page)
Maybe I should ask Jared if this is the property that the records should be filered on
(DONE)
