You were working on the Add Service page.

I think there will need to be a fair amount of javascript behind all the ServiceAddress details, that have to be added,
when adding a landline.  This will also be required of the Bulk Add Services.


I was thinking of maybe splitting all the various parts (Mobile Detail, Landline Detail) into separate Html Templates
And then have a template for the form, in which you bookend all the other html templates.  This is probably a bad idea.
It would be nice if the Add Service and Edit Service were similar enough so that the one Html Template could be used.


I was also thinking of modifying the Render/As methods so you could override the value for the left-offset of the property
and also override the width of the property, when rendered as an input.  This would help with the niceness of the layout
I should also modify the Render/As methods so that you can choose to override the ConditionContext selection.


Do a grep -i -R "Narrow-Form" and change them all to NarrowForm
