The last thing you were working on, on Friday was fixing all the table footers
(DONE, Monday 6-8-2007)

After that, test the download pdf functionality

Maybe stick the buttons on the console menu, in the table?

TODO!!!
Ask Jared about the filter combo box for the CDR table
Also, should the charge for each individual CDR be to 4 decimal places instead of just 2?
Answers: use 2 decimal places for this interface
The combo box should limit its contents to those that are used for the particular type of service.

TODO!
I originally had HtmlTemplateAccountUnbilledChargesList and HtmlTemplateServiceUnbilledChargesList, but they were exactly the same thing
so I've now flagged them as DEPRECIATED and made a class called HtmlTemplateUnbilledChargesList
Get rich to remove the 2 DEPRECIATED classes from svn (or maybe I could try removing them myself)

TODO!!!
In the services table of the Account/viewUnbilledCharges page, have the "current unbilled charges" for each service only include the CDR
charges, not the service adjustments
2
(DONE)

TODO!
Fix the Invoices and Payments table (WHAT ABOUT REVERSED PAYMENTS?)
3
(DONE, but what about reversed payments?)

TODO!
Add functionality to VixenTable so that you can specify the widths and alignments for a single row
4
(DONE, although you can't set overriding widths for a single row.  You can specify how many columns they span)

TODO!
Fix the Bread Crumb menu so that it includes the current page, but not as a link
1
(DONE)

TODO!
Fix the Console page, and the login screen so that it is all in the proper interface
(I should have only one login screen which should be located in page_template)
(The console should probably use a 3 column layout.  You might also want to include the page title in the layout templates as they currently are not)

TODO!
Stick buttons where they should be so that you can navigate through the system
6

TODO!
Test the download pdf functionality by having the InvoicePDFExists() and GetPDF functions point to a directory that
you can actually access.
5

TODO!
Currently the title of the page (which appears in the title bar of the firefox window) includes "Vixen: Employee Intranet System"
Get rid of this
8

TODO!
I should include the bread crumb menu when ever any of the error pages load so that the user can get back to where they were
9

TODO!
There is the distinct possibilty that when account details are loaded into the console page, the balance is incorrect, because we are
now looking at it through the point of view of the client.  This will either be an issue with the coloring of the balance, or the signage of the balance
